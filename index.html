            A selection of questions from the assignments will appear in <b>Quiz 1, Quiz 2, and the End-Sem Exam</b>,

            <li>While minor adjustments (typically by 1‚Äì2 points) to the above cutoffs may be made, given that the course has over 100 students, 
            it is inevitable that some students may miss a grade boundary by < 1 mark. Unfortunately, this is an inherent aspect of the grading system, 
            and no exceptions can be made in such cases.</li>
            <li>Students are strongly encouraged to focus on performing their best throughout the course and in the exams, 
            rather than requesting leniency in grades after results are announced.</li>

            <h3><i class="fas fa-bolt"></i> What is this course about?</h3>
            <p class="course-description">
                <b>Foundations of Machine Learning (DA5400)</b> is an introductory course designed to provide a strong conceptual foundation in <em>classical</em> machine learning.
            </p>
            <p class="course-description">
                The course covers fundamental algorithms, including regression, classification, decision trees, ensemble methods, support vector machines, clustering, 
                and dimensionality reduction, with a focus on their mathematical formulation and theoretical underpinnings.
            </p>
            <p class="course-description">
                Emphasis is placed on understanding core principles rather than implementation, making it ideal for students seeking a rigorous, algorithmic perspective on machine learning. 
            </p>
            <p class="course-description">
                While deep learning is not a focus, the course equips students with the necessary background to pursue more advanced studies in areas such 
                as deep learning, probabilistic modeling, and modern AI techniques.
            </p>
            

            <h3><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> Prerequisites</h3>
            <p>Students are expected to have the following background:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Knowledge of basic programming, at a level sufficient to write a
                    reasonably non-trivial computer program, ideally in Python.</li>
                <li>An undergraduate level understanding of Linear Algebra, Probability, and Multivariable Calculus. </li>
                <li>Lack of fear of Mathematics or Programming</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="honor-code"><i class="fas fa-eye"></i> Honor Code</h3>
            <p>Permissive but strict. If unsure, please ask!</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Attendance is <b>mandatory</b>. <span class="not-ok-text">NOT OK</span> to skip classes for non-medical reasons.</li>
                <li><span class="ok-text">OK</span> to use Gen AI tools or the internet to solve Exercise problems given in the course. </li>
                <li><span class="not-ok-text">NOT OK</span> to copy during the exams. This will lead to immediate referral to the Disciplinary committee and a U grade in the course.</li>
            </ul>
            

            <h3 id="honor-code" id="audit"><i class="fas fa-user-plus"></i> Audit policy</h3>
            <p>Anyone who wishes to drop the course, but sit through the classes is welcome to.

            <p>The slides, codes, assignments, will be made publicly
                available on the Syllabus page. But this depends on the time I have to do so. Please always take notes in class and do not depend on me uploading them.

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
 <!--        <div class="qqa">
            <div class="qq">How difficult is the course?</div>
            <div class="qa">
                The materials are not difficult to understand, but the final projects are fairly involved. We wouldn't
                recommend taking the course unless you're ready to build things and learn from hands-on experience!
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="qqa">
            <div class="qq">Does the course count towards CS degrees?</div>
            <div class="qa">
                For undergraduates, CS 329S can be used as a Track C requirement or a general elective for the AI track.
                For all other tracks, they would need to petition to use the course.<br><br>

                For master's students, CS 329S can satisfy the AI Specialization Depth C requirement. It can also be
                used as a general elective for all MS students, regardless of their specialization.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="qqa">
            <div class="qq">Are lectures recorded?</div>
            <div class="qa">Yes, the lectures will be recorded and made available to enrolled students, including SCPD
                students.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="qqa">
            <div class="qq">Is attendance mandatory?</div>
            <div class="qa">We won't be taking attendance but we expect to see you often in class. We love talking to
                students to understand how you are doing, make sure you get the most out of the class, and get your
                feedback to improve the materials. The class is relatively small so we will probably get to know each
                other well.<br>
                If you have a time conflict and can't attend the lectures, please send us an email to let us know!
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="qqa">
            <div class="qq">What is the format of the class?</div>
            <div class="qa">It will be lectures, tutorials, and discussion. We will often have industry experts to give
                us tutorials on tools for data streaming, experiment tracking, deep learning framework, monitoring, etc.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="qqa">
            <div class="qq">I don't have a team for the final project, can I still enroll?</div>
            <div class="qa">Yes. Most students don't have a team already when they join the course. We'll have
                activities for you to find project partners.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="qqa">
            <div class="qq">Can I work in groups for the assignments?</div>
            <div class="qa">Yes, in groups of up to two people.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="qqa">
            <div class="qq">How mature is the course?</div>
            <div class="qa">
                This is the second time the course is offered. The materials are a lot more developed compared to the
                first time, however, there is still a long way to go. We're trying our best to ensure the quality of the
                lectures, but here and there things might not be as polished as other courses. Your feedback will be
                greatly appreciated.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="qqa">
            <div class="qq">Do I need to know Python for the course?</div>
            <div class="qa">Since Python has become the most popular language for machine learning, we expect most
                tutorials will be in Python. Python fluency isn't required, but will make your life so much easier
                during the course.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="qqa">
            <div class="qq">Will the videos be made available publicly?</div>
            <div class="qa">We won't know untile the end of the course. We're trying, but it's not solely our decision
                to make. We'll announce on the <a
                    href="http://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/cs329s-win2021-guests">guest mailing list</a> if
                and when the videos are available.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="qqa">
            <div class="qq">Can I follow along from the outside?</div>
            <div class="qa">We'd be happy if you join us! All the slides and lecture notes will be posted on this
                website. You can also subscribe to the <a
                    href="http://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/cs329s-win2021-guests">guest mailing list</a> to

        <div class="qqa">
            <div class="qq">I have a question about the class. What is the best way to reach the course staff?</div>

                    forum</a> so that other students can benefit from your questions. If you have a personal matter or
